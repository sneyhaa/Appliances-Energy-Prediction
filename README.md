# Appliances-Energy-Prediction

Project Description:

This project aimed to predict household energy consumption by exploring various regression models. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, included temperature, humidity, and energy data for different appliances in a house, with additional weather parameters from a nearby station. The focus areas were the kitchen, laundry, and living room.

The project followed a comprehensive data modeling lifecycle, covering preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the application of predictive models. Key steps included visualization, missing value handling, data transformation, and outlier removal. Evaluation metrics such as RMSE and R-squared were employed.

Variable Introduction and Definitions:

Appliances: Energy use in Wh
Lights: Energy use of light fixtures in the house in Wh
Temperature and Humidity variables for different rooms and outdoor areas.
Approach and Conclusion:

The approach involved rigorous analysis, model selection, and comparison. Beginning with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the project addressed missing data, degenerate predictors, skewness, and outliers. After data cleaning, various regression models, both linear and non-linear, were trained and evaluated. Principal Component Regression and Logistic Regression emerged as the top-performing models, achieving RMSE values of 0.138 and 0.166, and R-squared values of 0.658 and 0.1, respectively. The README provides insights into feature engineering and a clear framework for predictive modeling.
